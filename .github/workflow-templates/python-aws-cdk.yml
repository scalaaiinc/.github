  # =================================================================
  #  Continuous Integration (CI) Job
  #  This job runs on every push, pull request, and release creation.
  #  It installs dependencies, runs tests, and reports coverage.

    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the repository code

      # 2. Set up the specified Python version

          pip install -r requirements.txt # Assuming you have a requirements.txt
          pip install pytest coverage # Install testing tools

      # 4. Run tests with coverage
      #    - Runs pytest on the 'tests/' directory.
      #    - Uses the coverage package to measure code coverage.
      #    - The `coverage report` command will display the results in the action's log.
